Solvent based paint, paint thinner and white spirit should be disposed of as hazardous waste.
General Comment / Tip
Keep your paint in tip top condition…

When opening lids, do so carefully to avoid damaging the can sealing ring

Protect the paint from frost and extreme temperatures as these can damage the paint

To stop your paint from drying out – ensure the lid is on securely and tightly; tip the container upside down for a few seconds (this will help stop a skin forming on the paint); store the paint containers in an upright position

Pass it on…

If you have unwanted paint, which is still usable there are several ways you can dispose of it.
Ask family and friends – it might be perfect for a painting project they have in mind

Industry operators – through membership of the scheme – take responsibility for the waste arising from the sale of tyres and vehicles at each stage of distribution.
All tyre operators must join the scheme to be compliant. A visible Environmental Management Cost (vEMC) will cover the environmental disposal of members waste tyres.
Repak ELT Registered Collectors will collect tyre waste from Repak ELT member outlets and will only be paid once they have submitted documentation proving that the tyres they collected were managed in an environmentally sound manner.
Producer responsibility initiatives in other waste streams have transformed waste with a negative value to one of positive value as a resource for recycled material and innovative green products. Tyres are currently a resource in that they can be recycled, recovered and processed.
Repak ELT tyre compliance scheme will work to bring improved environmental outcomes for end of life tyres. In time with the advancement of technologies, our goal is to see tyre waste moving to having a positive value."

General Comment / Tip
An end-of-life vehicle is a specified vehicle, such as a car, which is discarded or is to be discarded by its registered owner as waste. Vehicles normally reach the end of their useful lives, either due to age (typically around 12-14 years), or because of heavy damage following an accident. There is no fixed age, therefore, at which a vehicle can be considered an end-of-life vehicle. An end-of-life vehicle must be deposited at an authorised treatment facility. Each vehicle manufacturer or importer is required to have a national collection system in place made up of at least one such treatment facility in every city and council area. These facilities provide a free take-back service for vehicles of that producer’s brand. There may also be an independent facility in your area that will accept your end-of-life vehicle. If an end-of-life vehicle is deposited at an unauthorised facility, the owner will not receive a certificate of destruction and may remain recorded as registered owner of the vehicle on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport National Vehicle File."

Lever Arch Folders,"What?
A folder used by businesses and students for filing and storing notes
Where?

The plastic binder is generally not recyclable, unless it is made from eg polypropylene..
Comment
Virgin fibre paper ring binders are made from tree fibre and use a lot of water, energy and trees. If they end up in landfill it’s a great waste of valuable resources – it could have up to 7 more lives in recycled paper. Not only that, but in landfill as it decomposes it gives off methane – a greenhouse gas.
Plastics are made from non-renewable natural resources such as crude oil, gas and coal. Plastic binders can theoretically be recycled but most aren’t in practice. In landfill they hang round for centuries. The worst plastic lever arch files are made from or covered in PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) which is polluting and problematic both in production and in landfill."
